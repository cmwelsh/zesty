# Zesty

This is the WordPress base theme Zesty. Zesty is a powerful, yet simple, WordPress base theme with a responsive, mobile-first grid design. What that means is Zesty is a collection of best practices and patterns for maintainable, responsive WordPress themes. Since we base all of our projects on Zesty, we hope to share it with colleagues and friends so they may also benefit.

You can use the child theme Zestful as a starting point for your new projects:
https://github.com/cmwelsh/zestful

Please install Zesty and Zestful in the theme folder together and start
transforming the Zestful child theme into your client's website!

Everyone has their own preferences. This isn't meant to be the best solution
for everyone. It has opinions and conventions built-in.  You can fork this
base theme for even more customization - make this base theme your own!

# Requirements

Zesty requires PHP 5.3 or greater.

Zesty has been tested and is compatible with WordPress 3.4.2 and greater.

Zesty requires Ruby 1.9+. Eventually we'll package the Sass tooling into a cross-platform application, but for now you must have Ruby and you must manually install the master branch versions of the following gems:

* Compass 0.13 (alpha)
* Susy 1.0.5 (alpha)

This will be nicer once the major versions for these Sass libraries
are released.

Zesty highly recommends but does not require Advanced Custom Fields for creating custom WordPress meta boxes - use what works best for you: http://advancedcustomfields.com/
