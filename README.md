# Zestful

This is the WordPress base theme Zesty.

You can use the child theme Zestful as a starting point for your new projects:
https://github.com/cmwelsh/zestful

Please install Zesty and Zestful in the theme folder together and start
transforming this theme into your client's website!

# Requirements

Zesty requires PHP 5.3 or greater.

Zesty has been tested and is compatible with WordPress 3.4.2 and greater.

Zesty requires the master branch of Compass 0.13 (alpha) and Susy 1.0.5
(alpha). This will be nicer once the major versions for these Sass libraries
are released.
